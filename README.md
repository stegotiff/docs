## Welcome to Digital Image TimeStamping Projects

Digital image processing with tamper-proof timestamp stegano supports assertions of proof that a digital image existed before a particular time with integrity. I designed digital shadow concept to protect and proof that digital image is not tampered from which created first time.
As current, there is no solution for proof of existence and integrity for digital image. Digital watermarking technology is focused on protect owner licenses but not integrity with proof of existence.
With this solution, you can solve the legal compliance issue for scanning paper document, photo. As tamper-proof timestamping image, photo will be compromised way to digital transformation.
My solution for image integrity has unique way of image processing techniques.
There are two step for image processing to tamper-proof and existence-proof.
First step. Digital Shadow model will calculate each digital image's unique shadow data(footprint of image) which purpose to provide zero knowledge proof. I design zk-SNARKS method applies to digital image.
Second step. Steganography with timestamp/digital signed token data into digital image and detect method. Unlike almost competitors using one-way function(hash) technique, this solution use inverse function to proof of integrity.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/stegotiff/docs/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
